Hello ! I am a data scientist with extensive experience in building and deploying machine learning models, particularly in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.  Passionate about leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI to solve complex real-world problems. Proven ability to lead projects, mentor junior team members, and deliver impactful results.

My expertise includes:

* **Large Language Model (LLM) Engineering:**  Developing, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs for various applications, including  agent deployment,  textual data extraction, and guided generation.  I'm proficient in utilizing different LLM architectures and APIs.
* **Computer Vision:**  Building and deploying models for tasks such as image classification, image-to-image translation, and object detection.  Experience with both traditional and cutting-edge diffusion model techniques.
* **Machine Learning Engineering:**  Designing, implementing, and deploying scalable and robust machine learning pipelines using cloud platforms (e.g., GCP).  Proficient in CI/CD methodologies.
* **NLP:**  Expertise in tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and text classification.

My recent writing explores practical applications of LLMs and related technologies, detailing methodologies and code examples,  published in Towards Data Science:
